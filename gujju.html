             <h3>We invite you to explore our site and discover the academics 
                and community Gautam School provides to each and every student.
                 Get in touch with us today to schedule a tour, learn more about 
                 enrollment, or ask any other questions. We believe that all 
                 children can learn. We seek to improve our pupilsâ€™ basic skills,
                  to create a secure refuge where quality scholarship, punctuality,
                   and good citizenship are developed; to foster in our pupils the
                    desire and capacity to be life-long learners; to encourage and
                     channel their natural curiosity into constructive activity; 
                     to equip them to adapt to a technologically changing world;
                     and to instil in their recognition and acceptance of 
                     responsibility to the end of active, productive participation
                      in a democratic society.</h3>
